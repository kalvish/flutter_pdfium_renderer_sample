# flutter_pdfium_renderer_sample

A Flutter pdfium renderer based on the following package
https://pub.dev/packages/pdfium

## Getting Started

Currently only works on Android devices. This is because I have only added native pdfium libraries to relevant Android folders.
Other platforms can be added by adding/configuring platform specific pdfium sdk build files to relevant platform project location.

### 18th Nov, 2021
Built with Flutter stable channel 2.5.3
Added null-safety
Supports latest ffi and file_picker libraries
